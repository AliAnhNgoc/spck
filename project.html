          Women’s equal participation and leadership in all spheres of life is
          essential to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. In the
          Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, Member States
          acknowledged that women are a fundamental force for leadership,
          conflict resolution and the promotion of lasting peace. In the same
          vein, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development calls for women’s
          full and effective participation and equal opportunities for
          leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and
          public life.
        </p>
        <p class="about__background-p-about">
          Women and girls represent half of the global population, yet, women
          continue to be underrepresented in leadership positions in every
          region of the world. As of November 2018, only 10 per cent of UN
          Member States have a female Head of State or Government. Globally,
          only 24 per cent of parliamentarians are women. In 31 States, women
          account for less than 10 per cent of parliamentarians in single or
          lower houses, including 4 chambers with no women at all. Similarly,
          among the 2018 Fortune 500 companies, only 24 have women CEOs and 12
          companies have no women at all on their board.
        </p>
        <p class="about__background-p-about">
          In 2011, the GeneralAssembly expressed its concern that women in every
          part of the world continue to be largely marginalized from the
          political sphere often as a result of discriminatory laws, practices,
          attitudes and gender stereotypes, low levels of education, lack of
          access to health care and the disproportionate effect of poverty on
          women. The General Assembly also invited States to exchange experience
          and best practices on women’s political participation and encouraged
          States to support programmes that facilitate women’s participation in
          political and other leadership activities (A/RES/66/130).

          In this context, the high-level event will be an opportunity for
          participants to identify barriers that hinder women’s full
          participation and leadership, and to share best practices that can
          accelerate women’s empowerment in this area. The high-level event will
          also engage young women leaders to foster an environment of mentoring
          and dialogue between present and future leaders.

        The high-level event will bring together senior leaders and other
        participants from governments, the UN system, private sector and civil
        society, including youth organizations, to share experiences and learn
        from success stories on advancing women’s leadership. The program will
        feature an opening segment and three high-level roundtables. The
        President of the General Assembly will also host a working luncheon with
        young women leaders. A President’s summary of the discussions at the
        high-level event will be circulated to all Member States and other
        stakeholders.

          Marie Curie changed the world not once but twice. She founded the new
          science of radioactivity – even the word was invented by her – and her
          discoveries launched effective cures for cancer. "Curie boasts an
          extraordinary array of achievements, " says Patricia Fara, president
          of the British Society for the History of Science, who nominated the
          Polish-born French scientist. "She was the first woman to win a Nobel
          Prize, first female professor at the University of Paris, and the
          first person - note the use of person there, not woman - to win a
          second Nobel Prize."

        <div class="more__Amelia-p">
          Earhart took up aviation in 1921, aged 24, and went on to break the
          women's altitude record the following year when she rose to 14,000
          feet. In 1932 she became the first woman to fly solo across the
          Atlantic and over the next five years continued to break speed and
          flying records. In June 1937 she began a flight around the world,
          becoming the first person to fly from the Red Sea to India - she was
          reported missing on 2 July near Howland Island in the Pacific.
          Earhart's disappearance is one of history's unsolved mysteries and she
          was declared dead in absentia in 1939.
